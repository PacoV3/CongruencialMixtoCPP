# CongruencialMixtoCPP

CongruencialMixtoCPP is a C++ linear congruential generator that has to verify that every combination of variables is complete and can produce pseudo-randomized numbers.

## Implementation

On the repository you can find a [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) that can help you compile all the project just make a build directory and execute the next command inside.

```bash
cmake ..
```

Then use the command, and you are ready to execute the code.

```bash
make
```

## Usage

The final product would be located where you build the project, and it will be called "congruential" so just run it like.

```bash
./congruential
```
